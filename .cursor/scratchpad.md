# Punk Indexer Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
The user is working on a punk indexer project that needs to track CryptoPunks events and function calls. There are compilation errors in the Main.sol file that need to be fixed.

**New Request**: User wants to add a Chart.js chart to the React app (App.tsx) to visualize data from the punk-volume endpoint. The API base URL is: https://fe89cde530-3fca91b1fc.idx.sim.io/?api_key=sim_QYvahaISz1HLYCx4N4DFWjxJTbuYYAAF

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Syntax error in Main.sol line 31: `onPun` is incomplete
2. Missing implementation for `OnPunkImageSvgFunction()` in the Listener contract
3. The Listener contract needs to implement the correct interface for the SVG function from CryptoPunksOnchain

**Chart.js Integration Challenges**:
1. Need to install Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 dependencies
2. Must fetch data from punk-volume API endpoint with proper error handling
3. Need to transform API response data into Chart.js compatible format
4. Should handle loading states and API errors gracefully
5. Chart should be responsive and visually appealing
6. Need to understand the punk-volume data structure to create appropriate chart type

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Previous Tasks (Solidity)
- [ ] Fix syntax error on line 31 in Main.sol
- [ ] Add proper interface implementation for CryptoPunksOnchain functions
- [ ] Implement the missing OnPunkImageSvgFunction method
- [ ] Test compilation to ensure all errors are resolved

### Chart.js Integration Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1**: Install Chart.js dependencies (chart.js, react-chartjs-2)
  - Success criteria: Dependencies installed without conflicts, no npm audit issues
- [ ] **Task 2**: Test punk-volume API endpoint to understand data structure
  - Success criteria: Successfully fetch data and document the response format
- [ ] **Task 3**: Create data fetching hook/function with error handling
  - Success criteria: Function fetches data, handles loading/error states, includes proper TypeScript types
- [ ] **Task 4**: Transform API data into Chart.js format
  - Success criteria: Data transformation function converts API response to chart-compatible format
- [ ] **Task 5**: Implement Chart component in App.tsx
  - Success criteria: Chart renders correctly, shows punk volume data, responsive design
- [ ] **Task 6**: Add loading states and error handling to UI
  - Success criteria: User sees loading indicator, error messages display appropriately
- [ ] **Task 7**: Style and polish the chart integration
  - Success criteria: Chart looks professional, integrates well with existing UI

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Fixed compilation errors in Main.sol:
- Fixed syntax error on line 31
- Corrected interface implementation
- Fixed function call issues
- Ready for compilation testing

Added OTC Sales endpoint:
- Created otc-sales.ts query with date filtering (defaults to last 30 days)
- Added /otc-sales endpoint with proper validation and error handling
- Fixed table name issue (corrected from "where-nightly-zTfMvMyeEL" to "will-late-cK6wtMS1FB")
- Endpoint ready for testing

Added First Purchase endpoint:
- Created first-purchase.ts query analyzing first-time CryptoPunk buyers
- Tracks buyer's first purchase using ROW_NUMBER() window function
- Added /first-purchase endpoint (no date filtering per user request)
- Includes punk details URL and filters out zero addresses
- Endpoint ready for testing

Added Punk Seller Fatigue endpoint:
- Created punk-seller-fatigue.ts query combining sales and offers data
- Converted BigQuery syntax to PostgreSQL compatible SQL
- Filters data since April 5, 2021 using block_timestamp
- Distinguishes between actual sales (non-zero to_address) and offers (zero to_address)
- Orders by punk_id and timestamp (most recent first)
- Added /punk-seller-fatigue endpoint
- Endpoint ready for testing

## Project Status Board
- [x] Fix Main.sol compilation errors
- [ ] Test compilation
- [ ] Verify all triggers are working correctly

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Completed OTC Sales endpoint implementation:

**Task completed successfully**: Added `/otc-sales` endpoint with the following features:
- Queries `punk_bought` table excluding zero address transfers
- Supports optional `start_date` and `end_date` query parameters (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Defaults to last 30 days if no dates provided
- Includes proper date validation and error handling
- Returns data with ETH conversion and metadata

**Issues identified and resolved**: 
1. Schema-qualified table name was causing permission issues. Changed from `"where-nightly-zTfMvMyeEL".punk_bought` to unqualified `punk_bought` to match the pattern used in the working punk-holders query.
2. Removed timestamp filtering from first-purchase endpoint per user request - now returns all first purchases without date restrictions.
3. Fixed UNION type mismatch in punk-seller-fatigue query by casting `txn_hash` to text type to match with string literals.

All endpoints are ready for testing and should now work correctly.

**API Integration Task Completed Successfully**: 
- Integrated punk-volume API endpoint into React App.tsx
- Corrected API URL to: https://fe89cde530-4166ec59be.idx.sim.io/punk-volume?api_key=sim_QYvahaISz1HLYCx4N4DFWjxJTbuYYAAF
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces based on actual API response structure
- Implemented loading states, error handling, and data display
- Added refresh button for manual data fetching
- Data displays in formatted JSON for easy viewing
- **CORS Issue Resolved**: Added Vite proxy configuration to handle cross-origin requests
  - Updated vite.config.ts with proxy settings
  - Changed API calls to use `/api/` prefix which gets proxied to the external API
  - This allows the frontend to make API calls without CORS restrictions
- **Chart Visualization Completed**: Added interactive Chart.js charts
  - Installed chart.js and react-chartjs-2 dependencies
  - Created line chart for daily trading volume (ETH) over last 30 days
  - Created bar chart for daily sales count over last 30 days
  - Added summary statistics cards with key metrics
  - Implemented responsive chart sizing and professional styling
  - Raw data still accessible via collapsible section
- **Dynamic Chart Controls Added**: Implemented dropdown controls for data visualization
  - Added data type dropdown with 8 options: total volume, sales count, avg/min/max prices, and percentiles
  - Added time interval dropdown: daily, weekly, monthly data
  - Charts automatically update when selections change
  - API calls dynamically use selected interval parameter
  - Chart type switches between Line (for prices/volume) and Bar (for sales count)
  - Chart titles and labels update dynamically based on selections
- Ready for user testing and further UI improvements

## Lessons
- Always check for syntax errors before implementing new features
- Ensure all interface methods are properly implemented
