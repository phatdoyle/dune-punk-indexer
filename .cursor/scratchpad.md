# Punk Indexer Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
The user is working on a punk indexer project that needs to track CryptoPunks events and function calls. There are compilation errors in the Main.sol file that need to be fixed.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Syntax error in Main.sol line 31: `onPun` is incomplete
2. Missing implementation for `OnPunkImageSvgFunction()` in the Listener contract
3. The Listener contract needs to implement the correct interface for the SVG function from CryptoPunksOnchain

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [ ] Fix syntax error on line 31 in Main.sol
- [ ] Add proper interface implementation for CryptoPunksOnchain functions
- [ ] Implement the missing OnPunkImageSvgFunction method
- [ ] Test compilation to ensure all errors are resolved

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Fixed compilation errors in Main.sol:
- Fixed syntax error on line 31
- Corrected interface implementation
- Fixed function call issues
- Ready for compilation testing

Added OTC Sales endpoint:
- Created otc-sales.ts query with date filtering (defaults to last 30 days)
- Added /otc-sales endpoint with proper validation and error handling
- Fixed table name issue (corrected from "where-nightly-zTfMvMyeEL" to "will-late-cK6wtMS1FB")
- Endpoint ready for testing

Added First Purchase endpoint:
- Created first-purchase.ts query analyzing first-time CryptoPunk buyers
- Tracks buyer's first purchase using ROW_NUMBER() window function
- Added /first-purchase endpoint (no date filtering per user request)
- Includes punk details URL and filters out zero addresses
- Endpoint ready for testing

Added Punk Seller Fatigue endpoint:
- Created punk-seller-fatigue.ts query combining sales and offers data
- Converted BigQuery syntax to PostgreSQL compatible SQL
- Filters data since April 5, 2021 using block_timestamp
- Distinguishes between actual sales (non-zero to_address) and offers (zero to_address)
- Orders by punk_id and timestamp (most recent first)
- Added /punk-seller-fatigue endpoint
- Endpoint ready for testing

## Project Status Board
- [x] Fix Main.sol compilation errors
- [ ] Test compilation
- [ ] Verify all triggers are working correctly

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Completed OTC Sales endpoint implementation:

**Task completed successfully**: Added `/otc-sales` endpoint with the following features:
- Queries `punk_bought` table excluding zero address transfers
- Supports optional `start_date` and `end_date` query parameters (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Defaults to last 30 days if no dates provided
- Includes proper date validation and error handling
- Returns data with ETH conversion and metadata

**Issues identified and resolved**: 
1. Schema-qualified table name was causing permission issues. Changed from `"where-nightly-zTfMvMyeEL".punk_bought` to unqualified `punk_bought` to match the pattern used in the working punk-holders query.
2. Removed timestamp filtering from first-purchase endpoint per user request - now returns all first purchases without date restrictions.
3. Fixed UNION type mismatch in punk-seller-fatigue query by casting `txn_hash` to text type to match with string literals.

All endpoints are ready for testing and should now work correctly.

## Lessons
- Always check for syntax errors before implementing new features
- Ensure all interface methods are properly implemented
