# Punk Indexer Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
The user is working on a punk indexer project that needs to track CryptoPunks events and function calls. There are compilation errors in the Main.sol file that need to be fixed.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Syntax error in Main.sol line 31: `onPun` is incomplete
2. Missing implementation for `OnPunkImageSvgFunction()` in the Listener contract
3. The Listener contract needs to implement the correct interface for the SVG function from CryptoPunksOnchain

## High-level Task Breakdown
- [ ] Fix syntax error on line 31 in Main.sol
- [ ] Add proper interface implementation for CryptoPunksOnchain functions
- [ ] Implement the missing OnPunkImageSvgFunction method
- [ ] Test compilation to ensure all errors are resolved

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Fixed compilation errors in Main.sol:
- Fixed syntax error on line 31
- Corrected interface implementation
- Fixed function call issues
- Ready for compilation testing

## Project Status Board
- [x] Fix Main.sol compilation errors
- [ ] Test compilation
- [ ] Verify all triggers are working correctly

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Need to fix the compilation errors in Main.sol before proceeding with other tasks.

## Lessons
- Always check for syntax errors before implementing new features
- Ensure all interface methods are properly implemented
